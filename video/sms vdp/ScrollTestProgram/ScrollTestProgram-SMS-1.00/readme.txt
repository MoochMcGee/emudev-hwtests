 Program which enables scroll lock for the top two rows and right eight
 columns, then tries to scroll the display in multiple directions at
 three points in the frame (lines 40, 40, C0)

 Since the Y scroll can't be modified during the active display period,
 all parts of the display except for those affected by the right column
 lock feature should scroll upwards.
